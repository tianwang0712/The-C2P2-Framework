### How we developed the C2P2 Framework 1.0

#### Phase 1: Reviewed existing literature to understand how privacy protections were studied and what methodologies were used to investigate privacy protection criteria.

Phase 1 of our research was the exploratory phase, where we identified relevant literature and formed an initial list of frameworks to analyze. Our researchers used search strings like "privacy in the cloud," "privacy certification in the cloud," "privacy and security certification," and "privacy and security certifications in the cloud” to identify scholarly works in this area The keywords were chosen to ensure the results focus on privacy protections in the cloud environment. A focused and systematic review of the scholarly literature related to privacy protection was then conducted by the researchers.

After the review of all the selected papers—including papers that had "privacy" in their titles or abstracts—it was evident that those papers used privacy and security interchangeably and nine of the papers only focused on security. Therefore, we classified this literature into five categories based on the concentration of the paper. These categories included "Security Focused," "Privacy Focused," "Framework Based," "Social/legal Focused," and "Review Paper". This literature review led us to identify the first six privacy frameworks that we could use for further analysis, including two standards (both from NIST), two guidelines (GDPR, CCPA), one principle (FIPPs), and one control framework (CSA CCM). 

#### Phase 2: Used the six frameworks identified in Phase 1 to initiate the systematic and scientific review and development of the privacy criteria list.

In Phase 2, a team of three researchers independently reviewed each source carefully and marked all content related to privacy protection. After that, the initial results were shared with a few privacy colleagues from the industry to ensure real-world applicability, and we determined that additional frameworks need to be included in the review. The discussion led to adding four more privacy frameworks in our analysis, which provided a total of ten privacy frameworks, standards, and principles that were available publicly as of March 2020 worldwide. The final list for the in-depth analysis included: FIPPs, GDPR, NIST's privacy framework, CSA CCM, California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), APEC’s privacy framework, Australia’s Privacy Act 1988, NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5, and the FTC Act. We also included the South Asia Pacific Data Protection Guide prepared by the law firm Hogan Lovells to understand developments in the region beyond APEC. These ten frameworks were selected because they represent the widely applied privacy documents that are publicly available in English. There are also other privacy-related frameworks, but most of them are based on at least one of the ten selected sources.

The researchers conducted an in-depth review and analysis of each source and copied all privacy-related criteria from each source to build the new comprehensive list. A total of 123 criteria copied into the list were evaluated for privacy relevancy.

#### Phase 3: Evaluate privacy relevancy for all identified criteria.

In Phase 3, three researchers independently evaluated and scored all the criteria collected based on privacy relevancy. Criteria were ranked on a Likert scale based on explicit or implicit relevance to privacy. Scores were assigned from 1 (not related to privacy at all) to 5 (strongly related to privacy), and a score of 3 indicated unclear relevance to privacy. 

After assigning scores, the three researchers discussed the assigned scores as a team. 

1. If a criterion received a score of less than 3 by at least two researchers, then it was marked for removal (11 criteria were marked as removal).
2. If a criterion received a score of 3 by any researcher, then it was marked as “uncertain” (15 criteria were marked as uncertain).
3. The other 97 criteria remained on the list for further analysis.

Two additional privacy experts from the industry were then invited to evaluate this scoring process and provide input for the criteria that were marked for removal and uncertain.  
1. The two privacy experts scored each of the criteria marked as uncertain on a scale of 1-5 following the above strategy.
2. They also reviewed the criteria marked for removal and provided input about whether each criterion was relevant or not to privacy. For example, "Technology Regulation" and "Collection" were marked for removal by the researchers, while the industry colleagues marked them as relevant.

Based on the feedback and insight the industry privacy experts provided, we started the second round of reviewing and scoring all of the criteria to ensure depth and broader inclusiveness of privacy-related criteria.   

Additionally, an average score for each criterion were calculated. For statistical purposes, a criterion considered not relevant to privacy was assigned a score of zero. The average score for each criterion was used to determine if a criterion would remain in or be removed from the final list. A criterion with a score of 3 or higher remained, while a criterion with a score of 2 or lower was removed. The analysis led to a total of 114 privacy relevant criteria for the initial C2P2 framework.

#### Phase 4: Identified and removed overlapping criteria to finalize the first version of the C2P2 framework.

In Phase 4, the three researchers independently reviewed all 114 criteria to identify similarities in meaning and functionality among criteria. Then, the three researchers discussed similar criteria to reach a consensus on whether each criterion was unique. This led to the identification of 107 unique criteria.
