## Developing the Comprehensive Criteria for Privacy Protections (C2P2) Framework for Cloud Computing
*An essential roadmap towards an inclusive privacy standard that information researchers and professionals can use to build controls and certifications.*

**We invite all privacy advocates, educators, researchers, and scholars to review and provide feedback for our newly developed C2P2 framework for cloud computing.**


### Overview of our C2P2 Framework

> Cloud computing holds the promise of democratizing access to many computer resources, such as software, by effectively outsourcing computing tasks. However, this raises a variety of security and privacy concerns. Researchers and professionals must maintain security and privacy protections when managing data and information in cloud environments. While several security-related strategies and protections have already been established, there is still no comprehensive set of controls or criteria that specifically addresses privacy protection in the cloud. Therefore, we propose an all-encompassing privacy framework for cloud computing: **the Comprehensive Criteria for Privacy Protections (C2P2) framework**. The C2P2 framework was developed through qualitative analysis and evaluation of ten major existing privacy-related documents. This initial and novel synthesis of the C2P2 framework includes 107 unique privacy criteria across thirteen categories. This is the first assessment of its kind for the current privacy-related frameworks and serves as the first step towards establishing a comprehensive set of privacy protection criteria in cloud computing.



### Rationale

The goal of developing the C2P2 framework is to provide a novel and comprehensive baseline privacy framework in cloud computing that can be extended and applied widely. It is critical and timely to distinguish between privacy and security controls to provide and maintain privacy protection for users. The approach we proposed is a roadmap towards building a comprehensive list of baseline privacy protection criteria that will be refined with the global privacy community's input. In the Internet age, organizations must prioritize their customers' privacy protections so that they can maintain their users' trust—a key factor for organizations' growth. In addition, as ever more invasive technologies advance, personal information can be easily shared through cloud environments across the globe, and the creation of a global privacy protection standard such as C2P2 is more important than ever. Our research shows that while each region in the world has developed some form of privacy framework, our systematic approach is the first-ever comprehensive set of privacy protections, integrating ten standards, guidelines, and frameworks from around the world. In the future, the C2P2 framework could serve as a baseline privacy protection framework for cloud computing that can be adopted by any organization and in any region around the world.

### Next Steps

This portion of the study has primarily used qualitative analysis to develop the initial framework, but researchers are still in the early steps of evaluating the framework from a quantitative and computational point of view. The future work is expected to involve more advanced analyses and automation, such as advanced machine learning technologies (e.g., Natural Language Processing) and automated dictionaries or taxonomies, to verify the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the proposed C2P2 framework and to extend the analysis to additional publicly available privacy frameworks.
